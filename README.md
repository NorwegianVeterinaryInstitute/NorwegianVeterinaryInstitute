## The Norwegian Veterinary Institute

[The Norwegian Veterinary Institute](www.vetinst.no) is a biomedical research institute, and the national leading centre of expertise in biosecurity in fish and land animals. The aim of the Institute is to become Norwayâ€™s centre of preparedness for One Health.  

This github site is where the Institute keeps code and other resources. We welcome comments and feedback on our work. The best way to do that is to submit an issue in the relevant repo. 

### Major groups

We have several subgroups that use the NVI github repo. 

#### The Bioinformatics group

Bioinformatics is a growing field at the Institute. We currently have three dedicated people working on bioinformatics, and quite a few projects in that area.

### Salmon lice group

We are also quite active in the salmon louse area, and work on that can also be found in the NVI repos. 

### Support or Contact

For more general questions about NVI on github, contact karin dot lagesen at vetinst dot no.
